<A NAME="ancre2248559"></A>About the release 1.80</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>MidiShare version 1.80 is an Open Source Release: its source
  code is publicly available under the GNU Library General Public
  License. The kernel architecture has been slightly revised in
  order to facilitates porting on new platforms. A GNU/Linux version
  has been designed, based on this architecture.<BR>
  The main change consists in removing the IO drivers from the
  kernel itself and in providing mechanisms to plug these drivers
  dynamically as external ressources. Therefore, a new manager,
  the Drivers Manager, is part of the MidiShare kernel architecture:
  it is in charge of the drivers activation, it also routes the
  events to their final destination according to the drivers setup.<BR>
  This document describes these changes and gives the reference
  of the new functions and data structures introduced with this
  new architecture. The reader is supposed to be familiar with
  the MidiShare Developer Documentation.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><A NAME="ancre2248845"></A>Overview of the MidiShare Drivers
Management</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The underlying idea of the drivers management is that a driver
  behaves like any MidiShare client except for a special call required
  to register (or unregister) as a driver. All the MidiShare API,
  extended by a set of new functions detailed below, are available
  to the drivers. Therefore, input / output operations may be performed
  using the standard MidiShare mecanisms:</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
  <UL>
    <LI>MidiShare events to be send to the physical ports may be
    handled in real-time using a MidiShare received alarm.
    <LI>events received by the driver from the physical ports may
    be given to the MidiShare kernel using standard MidiSend functions.
  </UL>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="ancre2250428"></A>General operation</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Loading drivers in memory is a platform dependant operation
  (so as unloading), in charge of the Drivers Manager. It is the
  driver responsability to register and unregister: it may be done
  at any time. However, the driver should act according to the
  MidiShare state:</P>
  <P>- when MidiShare is dormant, the driver should be dormant</P>
  <P>- when MidiShare wakes up, the driver should also be woken.</P>
  <P>Therefore, in order to be notified of the kernel state changes,
  a driver should provide callbacks at register time. The TDriverOperation
  data structure is intended to store these callbacks:</P>
  <PRE>
       typedef struct TDriverOperation {
		void 		(* wakeup) (void);
		void 		(* sleep)  (void);
		long		reserved[3];
	} TDriverOperation;</PRE>
  <P>The following functions are provided for drivers management
  :</P>
  <PRE>short    <A HREF="MSH_Fonctions/MidiRegisterDriver.html">MidiRegisterDriver</A>  (TDriverInfos * infos, TDriverOperation *op)
void 	 <A HREF="MSH_Fonctions/MidiUnregisterDriver.html">MidiUnregisterDriver</A>(short refnum)
short	 <A HREF="MSH_Fonctions/MidiCountDrivers.html">MidiCountDrivers</A>    ()
short	 <A HREF="MSH_Fonctions/MidiGetIndDriver.html">MidiGetIndDriver</A>    (short index)
Boolean  <A HREF="MSH_Fonctions/MidiGetDriverInfos.html">MidiGetDriverInfos</A>  (short refnum, TDriverInfos * infos)</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><A NAME="ancre2258896"></A>The MidiShare driver</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Like the MidiShare application, automatically opened with
  the first client, a MidiShare driver is created at wakeup time:
  it should be considered as the driver image of the MidiShare
  application. As MidiShare client applications should connect
  to MidiShare to communicate with the drivers, the MidiShare drivers
  should connect to the driver image of MidiShare to communicate
  with the client applications.<BR>
  The MidiShare reference number is 0 for the client applications
  and 127 for the drivers.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><A NAME="ancre2270587"></A>Slots Management</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>To differenciate between MidiShare logical ports and input
  / ouput ports supported by a driver (Serial ports, USB...) we'll
  talk about 'slots' when we'll refer to a driver port.<BR>
  A driver should declare all its available slots using the MidiAddSlot
  function, which returns a system unique slot reference number.
  This reference number is composed of the driver reference number
  and a slot reference number unique in the driver context.</P>
  <PRE>	typedef struct {
		short	drvRef;	/* the driver reference number */
		short slotRef;	/* the slot reference number   */
	} SlotRefNum;</PRE>
  <P>The following functions are provided for the slots management
  :</P>
  <PRE>
SlotRefNum	<A HREF="MSH_Fonctions/MidiAddSlot.html">MidiAddSlot</A>     (short refnum, SlotName name, SlotDirection direction)
SlotRefNum	<A HREF="MSH_Fonctions/MidiGetIndSlot.html">MidiGetIndSlot</A>  (short refnum, short index)
void        <A HREF="MSH_Fonctions/MidiRemoveSlot.html">MidiRemoveSlot</A>  (SlotRefNum slot)
Boolean     <A HREF="MSH_Fonctions/MidiGetSlotInfos.html">MidiGetSlotInfos</A>(SlotRefNum slot, TSlotInfos * infos)</PRE>
  <P>MidiShare allows dynamic routing of the events from one port
  to any of the available slots. For this reason, a slot can be
  connected to one or several MidiShare ports. The Driver Manager
  is in charge of dispatching the events to or from the drivers
  according to the connections set between the event port and the
  drivers slots.<BR>
  The following functions are provided for the slot connections
  management :</P>
  <PRE>
void    <A HREF="MSH_Fonctions/MidiConnectSlot.html">MidiConnectSlot</A> (short port, SlotRefNum slot, Boolean state)
Boolean <A HREF="MSH_Fonctions/MidiIsSlotConnected.html">MidiIsSlotConnected</A> (short port, SlotRefNum slot)</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><A NAME="ancre2259183"></A>Additionnal change codes</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The following alarm codes are defined to notify the client
  applications of changes concerning the drivers:</P>
  <PRE>
MIDIOpenDriver     /* notified when a driver opens */
MIDICloseDriver    /* notified when a driver closes */
MIDIAddSlot	       /* notified when a slot is added to the system */
MIDIRemoveSlot     /* notified when a slot is removed from the system */
MIDIChgSlotConnect /* notified when the slots connections change */</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE></PRE>

<H2><A NAME="ancre2261470"></A>Connections restrictions</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Regular MidiShare clients and MidiShare drivers are considered
  to be part of separate communication folders. An additionnal
  connection rule is given : a connection is not allowed to cross
  a folder boundary. Therefore, connections can be made between
  regular clients or between drivers but NOT between a driver and
  a regular client. Such connections requests will be silently
  ignored by the kernel.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><A NAME="ancre2265811"></A>Obsolete functions</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The functions below are obsolete:</P>
  <PRE>
Boolean MidiGetPortState (short port)	
void    MidiSetPortState (short port, Boolean state)</PRE>
  <P>For compatibility, the corresponding entry points are supported
  in the Macintosh version but the functions do nothing and MidiGetPortState
  always returns true.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
