This workaround is to get MidiShare working under Carbon builds, normally not possible 
since MidiShare uses 68k kernal.

- A special MidiSharePPC_Carbon.h include file has to be used. 
- The MidiSharePPC_Carbon.c has to be included in the project to allow Carbon code to access 
MidiShare API.

Warning! Warning!
-----------------

To use the MidiShare API with Carbon, some specific intitialisation code has to be called.
This code has been added in the standard MidiShare() test function, since MidiShare() is 
supposed to be called before any other MidiShare function.
(see MidiSharePPC_Carbon.h and MidiSharePPC_Carbon.c)

BE SURE to call MidiShare() at the beginning of your progamm to have enrything work properly.
