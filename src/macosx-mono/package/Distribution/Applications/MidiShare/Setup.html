<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Since MidiShare 1.80, the drivers are separate
  components. They can be dynamically loaded and unloaded, as any
  other MidiShare client application. On MacOSX, the drivers are
  provided as shared libraries. Available drivers are mentionned
  in the 'midishare.ini' file.</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Each driver is declaring input and output
  slots, corresponding to the supported input and output ports.
  For example, the Quicktime driver declare a single output slot
  named 'Quicktime GM Synth'.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">To send or receive from the drivers, an
  application should be connected to MidiShare. Routing the events
  stream to the slots is done using connections which operates
  like inter-application connections :</FONT></P>

    or several slots: every event sent to MidiShare on this port
    will generate a MIDI message on the corresponding slots.</FONT>

  application used to setup the connections between MidiShare ports
  and driver slots.</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The user interface is similar to msConnect
  : on the left are the input slots, on the right the output slots
  and on the middle, a 16 X 16 matrix which represents the 256
  MidiShare ports. Ports outlined in blue color are busy ports
  (ie ports which are connected to at least one slot), the others
  are free ports (ie ports which are not connected to any slot).</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">With a mono-application release : 
<UL>
<LI> different MidiShare clients won't be able to communicate unless they run in the same address space (ie they belong to the same process) but <B>will be able to share the MIDI drivers and thus access the input output devices at the same time. </B> 
<LI> since there is no global state shared by all MidiShare clients, a change done in port/slot connections with the Drivers Manager <B> willl not be reflected immediately </B> for other running MidiShare clients. The driver manager has to be closed so that the it's new state is saved in the .ini file, and clients will have to be<B> quitted and relaunched to see the new state.</B>
