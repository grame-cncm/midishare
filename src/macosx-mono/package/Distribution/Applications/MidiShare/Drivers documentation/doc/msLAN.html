for Mac OSX</FONT></CENTER></H1>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The MidiShare LAN Driver provides low latency
real-time network communication to MidiShare client applications.
<BR>
This communication is restricted to a local array network. Optimized
transmission assumes that the network is mainly dedicated to musical
transmission.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The MidiShare LAN Driver is sleeping as
long as no other MidiShare client application is running. While
in sleeping state, the station won't be visible by other stations
on the network. The driver wakes up when the first MidiShare client
application starts.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">At wake up time, the driver automatically
recognizes remote hosts on the network (provided that their drivers
are not in sleeping state). These hosts will appear as MidiShare
slots.</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Real-time transmission of the MidiShare
  events stream relies on 2 mechanisms :</FONT></P>
  <UL>
    <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">a grouping period : the period during
    which events are accumulated before being transmitted on the
    network. It is intended to optimize network transmissions.This
    parameter controls the transmission behavior.</FONT>
    <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">a maximum latency : represents the maximum
    transmission time (from sender to receiver) allowed to ensure
    a correct time rendering of the transmitted events. It is intended
    to compensate for the network latency and the transmission time
    variations. This parameter controls the receiver behavior.</FONT>
  </UL>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The total delay introduced by the network
  transmission is equal to the grouping period + the maximum transmission
  delay.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">These parameters can be adjusted using
  the msLANDriver.ini file.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><FONT FACE="Arial">Initialization file 'msLANDriver.ini' :</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Net Params section :</FONT></P>
  <UL>
    <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">UDP port : represents the udp port number.
    Default value is 4950</FONT>
    <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Grouping time : represents the grouping
    period (see above). Default value is 10 mls.</FONT>
    <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Maximum latency allowed : (see above).
    Default value is 10 mls.</FONT>
  </UL>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The 'Hosts input connections' section :
<BR>
  written by the driver, this section contains IP numbers followed
  by a list of ports numbers representing input ports connections.
  When the corresponding host appears, these connections are restored
  by the driver. Uses the msDriver application to modify the connections
  state.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The 'Hosts output connections' section
  : <BR>
  written by the driver, this section contains IP numbers followed
  by a list of ports numbers representing output ports connections
  (see Hosts input connections).</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
