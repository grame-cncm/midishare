for Mac OSX</FONT></CENTER></H1>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The MidiShare WAN Driver provides real-time
network communication to MidiShare client applications over the
Internet. Remote host connection is controlled by the user using
the msWANDriver.ini file. Once connected to a remote host, it
will appear as a MidiShare port.<BR>
At connection time, the driver establish both a TCP and a UDP
socket between the local and the remote host.</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Arial">Real-time transmission mechanisms :</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Real-time transmission of the MidiShare
  events stream relies on 2 mechanisms :</FONT></P>
  <UL>
    <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">a grouping period : the period during
    which events are accumulated before being transmitted on the
    network. It is intended to optimize network transmissions. This
    parameter controls the transmission behavior.</FONT>
    <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">a maximum latency : represents the maximum
    transmission time (from sender to receiver) allowed to ensure
    a correct time rendering of the transmitted events. It is intended
    to compensate for the network latency and the transmission time
    variations. This parameter controls the receiver behavior.</FONT>
  </UL>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The total delay introduced by the network
  transmission is equal to the grouping period + the maximum transmission
  delay + the initial transmission delay. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">These parameters can be adjusted using
  the msWANDriver.ini file.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><FONT FACE="Arial">Initialization file 'msWANDriver.ini' :</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Net Params section :</FONT></P>
  <UL>
    <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">UDP port : represents both the udp and
    tcp port number. Default value is 4951</FONT>
    <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Grouping time : represents the grouping
    period (see above). Default value is 200 mls.</FONT>
    <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Maximum latency allowed :  (see above).
    Default value is 1500 mls.</FONT>
    <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Maximum input connections count : represents
    the total number of simultaneous incoming connections allowed.
    Default value is 20.</FONT>
    <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Hosts target : should contain remote host
    addresses (in the form 'computer.somedomain.com' or IP address).
    At initialization time, the driver setup a connection for every
    host specified on the host target line. Default value is empty.</FONT>
    <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Hosts unused : intended only to disable
    automatic connection to one host.</FONT>
  </UL>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The 'Hosts input connections' section :
<BR>
  written by the driver, this section contains IP numbers followed
  by a list of ports numbers representing input ports connections.
  When the corresponding host appears, these connections are restored
  by the driver. Uses the msDriver application to modify the connections
  state.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The 'Hosts output connections' section
  : <BR>
  written by the driver, this section contains IP numbers followed
  by a list of ports numbers representing output ports connections
  (see above).</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The msWANDriver logs all the connections
and possible problems to the msWANDriver.log file which is written
in your $HOME/MidiShare folder.</FONT></P>
