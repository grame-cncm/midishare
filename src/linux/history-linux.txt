2003/02/03 : Replace "/usr/src/linux/include" 
			 with "/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include"
			 in all makefiles in linux directory and subdirectories
			 
		   : prefixed by /sbin/ all the module functions to be compatible
		     with RH 8.0 (when going su, sbin is not in the PATH)
			 
		   : in linux/applications/samples/Makefile: a) removed dependecy
			 on /usr/lib/libMidiShare.so that prevent make to succeed 
			 if midishare is not yet installed.	b) replaced "INC = ../Headers"
			 with "INC = ../../Include" the correct path to "MidiShare.h"
			 
		   : in linux/applications/tools/makefile : added path to local 
			 MidiShare library : "LIB = -Wl,-L../../library -lMidiShare" for 
			 link to succeed when MidiShare is not yet installed
			 
		   : in linux/applications/radio-hd-server/makefile : replaced gcc
			 with g++. 
			 in linux/applications/radio-hd-server/msControlSignal.c : added
			 #include "server.h" to prevent compilation errors.
			 
		   : in linux/applications/radio-hd-server/makefile : replaced gcc
			 with g++. 
			 in linux/applications/radio-hd-server/msControlSignal.c : added
			 #include "server.h" to prevent compilation errors.
			 
		   : in linux/kernel/MidiShareLinux.c : new version of TimerTask to
			 take into account the value of HZ which may be different form 100.
			 
		   : in common/Memory/msEvent.c : added declaration for InitStructTbl()
		   
		   : in linux/kernel/msLoader.c : added MODULE_XXX declaration and switched 
		     the file from LGPL to GPL. The module will not taint the kernel any more.
			 The library itself remains LGPL.
			 
		   : in msInetDriver.cpp : replaced in function dateString() format %D by %d/%m/%Y
		     to avoid warning on year.
			 
		   : In lflifoLinux.h : check LOCK not defined before defining it in order to avoid 
		     warning on SMP configuration.
