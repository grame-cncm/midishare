<P>MidiShare is a real-time multi-tasks MIDI operating system
specially devised for the development of musical applications.
MidiShare provides high level services to the field of computer
music and MIDI applications. It is freely available to users and
developers. MidiShare exists since 1989 and several releases have
been developped for various platforms : Macintosh, Atari, Windows
3.1, Windows 95, Windows 32 bits thunk release. Embedded versions
have also been developped.</P>

<H1><A NAME="RTFToC2"></A>2. Kernel Description</H1>

<H2><A NAME="RTFToC3"></A>2.1. General architecture</H2>

<P>MidiShare is based on a client/server model. It is composed
of six main components : a Memory Manager, a Time Manager, a Task
Manager, a Communication Manager, a Scheduler and a Ports Manager.</P>

<P>The figure 1 shows the conceptual model of MidiShare :</P>

<UL>
  <LI>The <I>Scheduler</I> is in charge of delivering scheduled
  events and tasks at the right date. It allows events to be sent
  in the future as well as functions to be called in the future.
  This ability to schedule function calls is a very powerful mechanism
  which is particularly useful in real-time applications where
  multiple tasks need to run in parallel with precise timings.
  The scheduling algorithm used ensures a very low and constant
  time overhead per event, even when the scheduler is heavily loaded.
  <LI>The <I>Time Manager</I> maintains the current date of the
  system. It offers 1ms resolution and supports accurate transparent
  SMPTE synchronization.
  <LI>The <I>Communication Manager</I> routes events received from
  the scheduler to the client applications and ports manager according
  to the connections set between applications.
  <LI>The <I>Task Manager</I> is in charge of calling the tasks
  delivered by the scheduler.
  <LI>The <I>Memory Manager</I>&nbsp;is specially designed for
  real-time operations at interrupt level. It provides applications
  with a convenient and efficient way for storing, copying and
  deleting MidiShare events without using the host memory manager.
  <LI>The <I>Ports Manager</I> is in charge of the communications
  with the drivers. It supports up to 256 ports. It provides the
  mechanisms to plug the drivers in the kernel at wake up time.
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="RTFToC4"></A>2.2. Changes</H2>

<P>The reorganization of the source code, mainly intended to facilitate
porting, was the opportunity to introduce some changes in the
kernel architecture. Non public releases of MidiShare included
input and output MIDI drivers. The following releases are concerned:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>MidiShare for the Macintosh up to version 1.68
  <LI>MidiShare for the Atari up to version 1.68
  <LI>MidiShare 16 bits for Windows 3.1 up to version 1.57
  <LI>MidiShare 32 bits for Windows 95 up to version 1.04
</UL>

<P>In order to facilitate drivers development and to take a better
account of the different platforms particularities, the drivers
are now separate components and a new manager, the Ports Manager,
is part of the kernel architecture. It is in charge of loading
and plugging these drivers into the kernel.</P>

<P>The Port Manager design is in progress. Therefore, it is not
present in this distribution of the source code. It is part of
the first tasks to do to complete the new implementation of the
kernel. Its design will be discussed on the midishare-kernel mailing
list.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H2><A NAME="RTFToC5"></A>2.3. General operation</H2>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC6"></A>2.3.1. Waking up MidiShare</H3>

<P>As long as no client application is running, MidiShare is dormant
and has no effect on the operation of the computer. Following
the first MidiOpen, MidiShare wakes up and becomes active. It
should then perform the tasks necessary to come into service.
These tasks represent:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>initializing the kernel data structures.
  <LI>allocating and initializing the MidiShare memory space; both
  private memory and events memory are concerned.
  <LI>initializing the Ports Manager.
  <LI>initializing a task which will be called by interrupt at
  the MidiShare time resolution rate (should be every millisecond).
  We'll refer later to this task as the <I>Time Task</I>.
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC7"></A>2.3.2. Putting MidiShare to sleep</H3>

<P>MidiShare returns to its dormant state after the last MidiClose
is performed. It should then execute the corresponding reverse
tasks:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>stopping and releasing the Time Task.
  <LI>putting the ports Manager to sleep.
  <LI>releasing the memory space.
</UL>

<P>After returned to its dormant state, MidiShare should have
again no effect on the operation of the computer.</P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC8"></A>2.3.3. The Time Task</H3>

<P>Most of the MidiShare services are performed by the Time Task.
Called at the MidiShare time resolution rate, the Time Task is
in charge of the following:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>maintaining the date of the system.
  <LI>calling the Scheduler to perform a one step sorting and to
  get the ready events.
  <LI>dispatch the ready events according to their destinations.
  These destinations are determined by the current connections
  set. When the destination is a client application, events are
  stored in its fifo. When the destination is MidiShare itself,
  events are passed to the Ports Manager.
  <LI>activating the real-time tasks scheduled by client applications.
  <LI>activating the real-time receive alarms for the concerned
  applications ie applications which received a new event in their
  fifo.
</UL>

<P>Real-time tasks, receive alarms, inter-applications communication,
input / output (using MIDI protocol or any other implemented by
the drivers) are mainly dependent of the Time Task operation.
As this task should be called every millisecond, a great attention
must be given to its implementation and especially to its efficiency.</P>

<H3><BR>
<A NAME="RTFToC9"></A>2.3.4. Events Memory Management</H3>

<P>The MidiShare memory management is based on fixed-sized cells
(16 bytes) organized into events. The services provided by the
kernel are widely based on these events: they are used for inter
application communication, connections set, tasks storage, MIDI
and MIDIFile data storage... All the events are composed of a
header cell that may be followed by one or more extension cells.
Figure 2 describes the different fields forming the common cell
:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>the <TT>Link </TT>field is used internally for linking cells.
  <LI>the Date field contains the falling date of the event (from
  0 to 2n- 1).
  <LI>the <TT>refNum </TT>field contains the application reference
  of the event sender.
  <LI>the <TT>evType </TT>field contains the type of the event.
  <LI>the <TT>Port </TT>field contains the destination MIDI port
  of the event.
  <LI>the <TT>Chan </TT>field contains the MIDI channel of the
  event.
</UL>

<P>These six fields are always present and have always the same
meaning, whatever the type of the event, and they can be accessed
directly. The following Info part of an event contains special
fields who's purpose depends on the event type. In some cases,
the Info part contains a pointer to one or several extension cells.</P>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="KDG2.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" WIDTH="81" HEIGHT="81"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>Figure 2 : common event structure</CENTER></P>

<P>MIDI messages with 0, 1 or 2 data bytes, use only one cell,
as shown in figure 2. Their datas are stored in the Info field.</P>

<P>Some events (private events, process or dprocess events) need
more data storage. An extension cell is allocated and the Info
field of the main cell points to this extension like shown in
figure 3.</P>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="KDG3.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" WIDTH="192" HEIGHT="157"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>Figure 3 : 2 cells event structure</CENTER></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Variable length messages like System Exclusive, Stream or some
MidiFile type messages uses several linked cells to store their
variable number of fields. Their structure is described on figure
4. The main cell points to the last extension cell, which points
to the first extension cell. This structure is intended to provide
the most efficient way to add datas to a variable length message.
In particular, it will minimize the operations required to process
a MIDI System Exclusive stream from input.</P>

<H1><A NAME="RTFToC10"></A>3. Portability issues</H1>

<P>Several low level implementation parts of the kernel are platform
dependent and generaly concern critical services provided by the
host operating system. Among them are: installing an interrupt
service routine, sharing the events memory, switching from the
MidiShare kernel to a client process and synchronizing the client
processes. Modern operating systems provides high level functions
to perform all these tasks but they are generally not suitable
to operate in a realtime context. In particular, acuracy and efficiency
issues are critical for a correct operating of the MidiShare kernel.
Therefore, the implementation problems raised for each point are
detailed below.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H2><A NAME="RTFToC11"></A>3.1. The MidiShare process</H2>

<P>The MidiShare process represents the entity which owns the
necessary resources for the kernel operations ie memory and interrupt
service routine. It must ensure of the permanence of these resources
all along the kernel active period, from wake up time until sleep
time. The MidiShare process do not necessary refer to a process
as commonly defined by the operating systems. Its implementation
is generally dictated by the host operating system and may or
may not be such a process. One of the design issue is to choose
the most appropriate system resource for the implementation of
the MidiShare process. Efficiency and accuracy must be particularly
taken into account : for example, if the MidiShare process is
implemented as an operating system process and if the process
context switching costs are high, the resulting kernel will certainly
be inefficient as it will have to pay these costs every millisecond.</P>

<P>More generally, the interrupt service routine latency time
should not exceed 5% of the interrupt periodicity time. In the
case of MidiShare, it means that serving the interrupt should
be done in less than 50 usec.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="red_car.gif" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> <B><FONT COLOR="#000099" SIZE="+1">Implementation</FONT></B></P>

<P>The following functions are to be provided by any platform
dependant implementation :</P>

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#990000">void SpecialWakeUp (TMSGlobalPtr g)</FONT></PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>called at wakeup time. If necessary, this function should
  create the process which will own and manage the kernel critical
  resources. The argument `g' points to the global MidiShare environment.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#990000">void SpecialSleep (TMSGlobalPtr g)</FONT></PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>called at sleep time. If a separate process exists, in charge
  of the kernel resources, this function should cleanly close and
  release this process. The argument `g' points to the global MidiShare
  environment.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#990000">void OpenTimeInterrupts (TMSGlobalPtr g)</FONT></PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>this is the last task invoked at wakeup time. This function
  should activate an interrupt routine called every millisecond.
  The argument `g' points to the global MidiShare environment.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#990000">void CloseTimeInterrupts (TMSGlobalPtr g)</FONT></PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>this is the first task invoked at sleep time. This function
  should remove the interrupt routine and if necessary, release
  its associated resources. The argument `g' points to the global
  MidiShare environment.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><A NAME="RTFToC12"></A>3.2. Memory allocation</H2>

<P>Memory is allocated and owned by the MidiShare process. The
implementation can freely use any way to allocate the kernel internal
memory. It is different for events and filters memory :</P>

<UL>
  <LI>events memory must be shared by the MidiShare process and
  all the client applications : a pointer to a MidiShare event
  must refer to the same memory location whatever its context of
  use. It's the responsability of the MidiShare process to allocate
  such a memory at wake up time.
  <LI>filters memory must be shared by its application owner and
  the MidiShare process. It's different from the events memory
  because a filter is private to one application. Filter memory
  is allocated by the MidiShare process at application request
  by the way of the MidiNewFilter function.
</UL>

<P>The source code clearly separates these services using an allocation
function which takes as argument the type of the desired memory.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="red_car.gif" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> <B><FONT COLOR="#000099" SIZE="+1">Implementation</FONT></B></P>

<P>The following functions are to be provided by any platform
dependant implementation :</P>

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#990000">FarPtr(void) AllocateMemory (MemoryType type, long size)</FONT></PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>this function should allocates memory according to the desired
  `type' argument. The `size' argument specifies the desired memory
  size.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#990000">void DisposeMemory (FarPtr(void) memPtr)</FONT></PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>this function should release any memory block previously allocated
  using `AllocateMemory `. the `memPtr' argument points to the
  memory block.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Memory types are defined as below:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1">typedef enum {</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="-1">   kStdMemory,        /* no constraints on the allocated memory */</FONT>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H2><A NAME="RTFToC13"></A>3.3. Tasks and Alarms</H2>

<P>The MidiShare kernel provides realtime tasks and realtime alarms
to its client applications. Realtime tasks are stored in typeProcess
events, then inserted in the scheduler and activated at interrupt
level by the MidiShare process at falling date. Realtime alarms
are activated at application request in two cases :</P>

<UL>
  <LI>when a context change occurs: it corresponds to an application
  alarm, setup using MidiSetApplAlarm, it can be activated at any
  time, at interrupt or user level.
  <LI>when news events are stored in the application fifo: it corresponds
  to a receive alarm, setup using MidiSetRcvAlarm, it will always
  be activated at interrupt level.
</UL>

<P>The way used to activate a client task is platform dependent.
Some operating systems allows the MidiShare process to directly
call the client code: on the MacOS for example, the application
context is limited to a register context and can be easily restored
at no cost, allowing a task to be called by the kernel for an
application account.</P>

<P>Some other operating systems prevents such mechanisms by keeping
separate address spaces for each application: this is for example
the case of Windows 95 where realtime tasks are implemented as
part of a thread owned by the client application ; activating
a task consists then in waking up this thread, which raises all
the problems of acuracy, priority and context switching costs.</P>

<P>As realtime tasks and alarms are among the key services of
the kernel, their implementation must take a great care of acuracy
and efficiency. Activation of a client task is defined in the
implementation interface file.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="red_car.gif" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> <B><FONT COLOR="#000099" SIZE="+1">Implementation</FONT></B></P>

<P>The following functions are to be provided by any platform
dependant implementation :</P>

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#990000">TApplContextPtr CreateApplContext ()</FONT></PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>called when a MidiShare client opens. This function should
  provide the information necessary to restore its context at interrupt
  time.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#990000">void DisposeApplContext (TApplContextPtr context)</FONT></PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>called when a MidiShare client quit. If necessary, this function
  should release the resources allocated to create the application
  context.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#990000">void CallApplAlarm(TApplContextPtr context, ApplAlarmPtr alarm,</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#990000">                   short refNum, long alarmCode)</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#990000">void CallRcvAlarm (TApplContextPtr context, RcvAlarmPtr alarm,</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#990000">                   short refNum)</FONT></PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>these functions should provide a way to activate the corresponding
  alarms. They receive as arguments the previously created application
  context and the arguments of the alarm.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#990000">void CallTaskCode (TApplContextPtr context, TTaskExtPtr task,</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#990000">                   long date, short refNum)</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#990000">void CallDTaskCode(TApplContextPtr context, TTaskExtPtr task,</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#990000">                   long date, short refNum)</FONT></PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>these functions should provide a way to activate the corresponding
  tasks. They receive as arguments the previously created application
  context and part of the arguments of the alarm. User arguments
  can be accessed using the `task' pointer.</P>
  <P>Note that `CallDTaskCode' should not provide any particular
  mechanism to restore the application context: as the function
  is called by the client application and not at interrupt time,
  the application context should be already available to the caller.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H2><A NAME="RTFToC14"></A>3.4. Processes and synchronization</H2>

<P>Concurrent access to critical sections of the MidiShare code
raises the synchronization problems. Preemptive operating systems
provides the necessary mechanisms to solve these problems but
again, these mechanisms are generaly not suitable in a realtime
context : for example in Windows 95, waiting for a semaphore induce
priority inversions and results in bad performances from the efficiency
and acuracy point of view.</P>

<P>The current implementation generaly avoids the use of semaphores
by the way of lock free shared linked lists. The principle consists
in trying to modify a shared linked list using the synchronization
mechanisms generally available with modern micro-processors instructions
set : for example, the Motorola PowerPC microprocessor family
allows to put reservations on a memory zone, then, conditionnal
instructions operates only if the reservation is not altered,
on the contrary, the program have to loop until success. Such
mechanisms needs to be implemented using assembly language.</P>

<P>The only semaphore defined by the system is used to synchronize
the kernel wakeup and sleep tasks. The semaphore is activated
when a client application call MidiOpen or MidiClose.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="red_car.gif" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM"

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>should compare the `compareTo' argument with the value adressed
  by `adr'. If equal, the function should swap it with the `swapWith'
  argument and return true, otherwise, it should do nothing and
  return false.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
