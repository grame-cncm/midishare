<P>Chase Events makes sure that a Player is playing the correct patch regardless
of the position in which the track was started. To do that, the Player keeps
internally the whole state of program change, volume, pan or other controller
information which are inserted in the tracks. This state in automatically
updated when the Player moves in both directions. Chase Events can then
re-send MIDI events that occurred previously in the tracks.The following
types of events are chased: program change, controller (volumes, sustain..),
pitch-bend, channel pressure, key pressure and tune.The chase management
system is built using the following elements :</P>

  <LI><B>TChaserVisitor</B> : a score visitor, which uses a <B>TEventTable</B>
  object to keep events to chase.
  <LI><B>TChaserIterator</B> : a score iterator able to send chase events
