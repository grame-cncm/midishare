<P>Functions are provided to read on write MIDIfiles and convert
them to the MidiShare sequence format. When loading a multi-tracks
MIDIfile, the different tracks of the MIDIfile will correspond
to different tracks of the MidiShare sequence. This means that
all events of track 0 have a reference number of 0, all events
on track 1 have a reference number of 1 and so on. When saving
a format 1 MIDIfile, the function uses the events reference number
to create different tracks in the MIDIfile. The function always
write tracks in ascending order starting from track 0 (which is
the TempoMap). Notes events are written as a KeyOn/KeyOff pair
and EndTrack events are written automatically. If the sequence
does not contain a Tempo Map, the function writes a default Tempo
of 120 bpm and a Time Signature of 4/4. There are several C files
for MIDIFile management :<BR>
