<H3>Structural Patterns</H3>

<P>Structural patterns describe how classes and objects are composed
to form clusters.</P>

<P>The <B>Composite</B> pattern allows to build structures of
objects. T</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The <B>Decorator</B> pattern attach additional responsibilities
to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative
to subclassing for extending functionality.</P>

<H3>Creational Patterns</H3>

<H3>Behavioral Patterns</H3>

<P>Behavioral patterns encapsulate algorithms and the assignement
of responibilities between objects by defining the communication
between them as separate objects.</P>

<P>- An <B>Iterator</B> is a structure that is used to traverse
composites. An iterator provides a way to sequentially access
elements of an aggregate object without knowing the internal objet
representation or collection structure.</P>

<P>For the score management; the class <B>TScoreIterator</B> allows
to traverse the score. Moreover the TScoreIterator is a <B>robust
iterator.</B> It means that elements can be inserted and removed
in the score while iterators are defined on the score.</P>

<P>- A visitor allows to add news operations on the elements of
the composite structure without having to modify les classes used
in the composite structure.</P>

<P>For the score management; the class <B>TScoreVisitor</B> allows
to add operations on the score elemnts.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The Chain of Responsability patterns avoid coupling the sender
of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a
chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and
pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.
