/*!
\brief  A TRunningPlayer uses the Decorator pattern : additionnal behaviours are added 
 dynamically on the TPlayerInterface object being decorated.
 A TRunningPlayer calls the decorated player methods (Start, Stop, SetPosTicks)
 depending of the current running state, read in the TRunningState object.
