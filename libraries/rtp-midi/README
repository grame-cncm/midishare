####		      MIDISHARE RTP MIDI LIBRARY
##############



This library automates  the creation and the analysis  of RTP payloads
to the RTP  MIDI format as described  in [1]. It allows, in  case of a
client  sending  a RTP  MIDI  stream,  to  create from  incoming  MIDI
commands, RTP MIDI payloads to be  included in RTP packets. In case of
a receiving client,  it allows to extract MIDI  commands from incoming
RTP MIDI payloads  and to create, in case  of packet loss, appropriate
recovery commands that can be used to repair the stream. The client is
still  responsible  for  all  network interactions,  like  sending  or
receiving RTP packet, SDP and RTCP data.

### COMPILING & INSTALLING

You should have compiled MidiShare kernel and library before compiling
this  RTP MIDI  library.  The sendmidifile  example in  tools/examples
is also depending on the MidiShare Player library. 

	make
	make install	:: with root privileges



### DOCUMENTATION

More complete documentation can be build with doxygen [2] by running :

	make dox

This will build HTML documentation in doc/html and latex documentation
in doc/latex.
