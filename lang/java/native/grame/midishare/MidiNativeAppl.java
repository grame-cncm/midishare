This class allows a simpler manipulation of MidiShare applications in Java. 
A MidiNativeAppl instance is associated to a MidiShare application. Java code for
Alarms and Tasks is <b> directly called from the native side</b>. 
Use this class with caution  : since Java code is called from a native real-time thread, 
it has to be fast otherwise the application may ruin real-time performances of the machine.
