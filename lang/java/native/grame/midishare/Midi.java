/* Basic Midi Class : native methods call to MidiShare functions

/* Versions
/*
/* 123: Adaptation for JDK 1.1 (use of the String constructor in MidiFileStream.java)
/* 124: Correction of a ForgetTask bug  (test of the scheduler variable)
/* 125: Adaptation for the Player libaray 2.0 : no more kEventSync mode.
/* 126: Correction of a bug in MidiFile saving.
/* 127: On Macintosh MRJ, use of a CompletionRoutineNotifier for better incoming 
/* event management.
/* 128: Linux version 
/* 129: Add IsAcceptedPort, IsAcceptedChan, IsAcceptedType functions
/* 130: Functions for drivers management
/* 131: New PortPrefix event type
/* 132: New RemoveEv function
/* 133: Direct call of Java code for MacOSX
/* 134: Correct Midi.Share semantic : now the JMidi interface is loaded in Midi.Share 
/*      thus clients *must* use Midi.Share as the first call to the MidiShare API
