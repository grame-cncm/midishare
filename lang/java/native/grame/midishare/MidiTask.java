This class is the basic class of Midi tasks.

<BR>
- A task in  <B> kIdle </B> state can be scheduled using the <B> ScheduleTask </B>
  method of a MidiAppl instance. It's internal state becomes <B>kRunning </B>.
  A running task can not be scheduled anymore. The <B> ScheduleTask </B> will return false
  if called on a <B>kRunning </B> task.
<BR>
- A task in <B> kRunning </B> state can be forgeted using it's <B> Forget </B>
  method. It's state  becomes <B> kIdle </B> and the task can be scheduled again.
<BR>
- After it's execution (the task <B> Execute </B> method will be called by a MidiAppl instance),
  the task state becomes <B> kIdle </B> and the task can be scheduled again.
<BR>
Real tasks must be defined by deriving the MidiTask class and overloading the Execute method.
