  MidiShare JNI library
  Changes log
=====================================================


-----------------------------------------------------
version 1.1.4
- crash bug corrected, introduced with version 1.1.3 and the use
  of direct call to MidiAppl::ApplAlarm that was setting an incorrect 
  jni env at the first alarm call. This env was shared by the
  receive alarm that crashed at first event reception.
  Solved by using a specific env for ApplAlarm, computed at each
  alarm call.

-----------------------------------------------------
version 1.1.3
- crash bug corrected due to asynchrone reentrance between 
  MidiShare events handlers and java call to native code:
  the typical symptom was a receive alarm ca&ll interrupted by 
  a native ApplClose call (from MidiAppl). The rcv alarm was triggered
  by private events used by java to handle application alarms.
  Solved by a direct call to MidiAppl::ApplAlarm, removing the use
  of private events. However, the problem is still present and could
  occur for example if the application is receiving events at the time
  of the close call. Client applications should remove all connections
  and flush the buffers before closing.

version 1.1.2
- crash bug corrected with MidiGetName called with incorrect refnum

version 1.1.1
