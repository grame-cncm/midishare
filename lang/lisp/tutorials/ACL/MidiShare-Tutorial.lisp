;; 			MIDISHARE MINI TUTORIAL
;;
;; 	 This file is a small guided tour for using MidiShare with MCL3.9 and later.
;;
;; INSTRUCTIONS :
;; If MidiShare is not installed, you need to install it (http://www.grame.fr/MidiShare/)
;;
;; Then you need to load the "MidiShare.lisp" file (Load cmd in the Eval menu). 
;; It contains the lisp interface to MidiShare.
;;
;; Now you are ready for the guided tour. Just follows the instructions for each
;; tests starting from test 1. Don't skip any test because some of them depend of 
;; previous ones.
;;
;; 28-10-03 Rename type macro to evtype.
;; 04-11-03 Add some explanation for port/slot connection management in test 14.
;; 29-01-04 Updated for new MidiShare function behaviour.
